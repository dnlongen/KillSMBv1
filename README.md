# KillSMBv1
Disable client- and server-side SMB version 1

Multiple news outlets are [reporting a widespread outbreak](https://www.securityforrealpeople.com/2017/05/ransomware-now-comes-in-worm-flavor.html) of the "WannaCry" ransomware. Ransomware is malware that encrypts all the data on a computer, holding it hostage until the victim pays a ransom fee. This particular attack is especially insidious because it acts as a "worm" - it spreads from computer to computer on its own, without any interaction from users.

Disabling SMBv1 stops the service the worm exploits to spread.
